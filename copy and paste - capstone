SIMPLE SCENARIO:
During study hours, users often get distracted by websites like YouTube and Instagram.
 The program starts a focus session for a fixed time and reminds users to stay focused.
 After the session ends, users can freely access all websites again, improving productivity.

  Future Scope 
Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy use.
Allow users to set custom study times and site lists.
Include password protection to prevent early unblocking.
Add notifications or timer alerts for focus sessions.
Integrate with browsers or extensions for smarter blocking.
Provide usage statistics to track focus productivity.

Import module – Use time to track focus duration.
Define blocked sites – List distracting websites and set redirect to 127.0.0.1.
Get user input – Ask for focus session time in minutes.
Start session – Record start time and activate focus mode.
Block websites – Loop: add blocked sites to hosts file until time ends.
Unblock websites – Remove entries from hosts file after session.
End session – Inform user that websites are unblocked.
